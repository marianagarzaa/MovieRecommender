Project Name: Movie Reccomender 

Project Description: This movie reccomender takes information scraped from IMBDV (information retreival!) and then provides a way for the udser to find movie reccomendations 
based on filters of their choice. They can select a min rating and up to as many genres as they want to find good movies with that rating and of those genres (reccomendations!).
The way to use our app is to insert your min rating requirement, select the genres you want, and then click apply and wait for movies to appear as reccomendations! Behind the 
scenes, it works by scraping info on genre and rating from the top 250 IMBDV movies and then tagging their genre and rating and then filtering based on a user query. 

Work Breakdown: Together, we came up with the idea for our project and drew up a timeline and plan to follow to get the project in on time. Then Jai took the lead on the scraping portion and started the filtering functionality. Mariana added a few more filtering functions and then finalized our project with some CSS to make it more user friendly. Finally (with Jai's help) she deployed the site!
